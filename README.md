# Short OpenCV Code Snippets
A collection of simple projects focused on image processing and computer vision with C++. 

## Notes
- The morphological processing techniques considered include opening, closing, dilation and erosion
- The only ML-related technique in this repo is that on digit recognition based off the MNIST dataset.
